# MuxTune

MuxTune is the open-source implementation of our NSDI'26 paper [MuxTune: Efficient Multi-Task LLM Fine-Tuning in Multi-Tenant Datacenters via Spatial-Temporal Backbone Multiplexing](), building a multi-task PEFT backend for LLM fine-tuning APIs.

**NOTE:** A formal version of the system will be released soon. Please stay tuned!
